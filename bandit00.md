Downloaded and tested putty, an open source ssh and telnet client for windows. Telnet has no authentication and is not encrypted.

Will use ssh for the remainder of this CTF. SSH uses public key cryptograhy, also known as assymetric cryptography.

SSH can transfer files with SFTP and SCP. Standard port is 22.
