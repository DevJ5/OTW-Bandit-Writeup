We get a shell, that for some reason uppercases all our commands. 

There isn't much we can do here, except for trying some environment variables or command line arguments.

`$0` expands to the name of the shell or shell script.
`bash` and we get our normal shell back.

`cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit33`
